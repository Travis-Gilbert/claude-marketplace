# Plugin Inventory

Inventory generated for the Theorem's Harness upgrade.

The public model is now adaptive: `/harness` is the session/task opt-in and the
agent selects capability mixes as the work evolves. Utility commands remain for
narrow entrypoints, but they are not separate products.

## Skills

## Companion plugins (routing targets)

Plugins that Orchestrate routes to but does not own. Listed here so the
plugin-router agent knows the available delegation surfaces.

| Plugin | Version | Trigger intent | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ui-design-pro` | 1.2.0+ | "design this", "lay this out", "wireframe", "prototype", "build me a Y component", "how should this look" | Design planning, component selection from 39-item curated catalog + 19 vendored design-system repos (Radix, shadcn, Tailwind, ant-design, carbon, magicui, etc.), applied design theory (10 references) |

When routing design work, prefer `ui-design-pro` over hand-rolling. The
plugin's `design-pro` skill (v1.2.0 replacement of `design-theory`)
enforces a components-first protocol: catalog scan → vendored libraries
→ hand-rolled only as last resort with explicit justification.

## Profiles

Registry-level operating policies. Not skills, not slash commands. They
change run policy before the agent thinks. See `PROFILES.md` for the
registry contract.

| Profile | Kind | Default | Priority | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `engineers-mindset` | `orchestration_profile` | enabled | high | `ENGINEERS_MINDSET.md` |
| `concise-action` | `output_profile` | enabled | high | `CONCISE_ACTION.md` |

Selected profiles (e.g. `developer-core`, `researcher-core`) are chosen
per task by the orchestrate backend and carried in
`decision.selected_profile_id`. They are not registry-static and are not
listed here.

## Agents

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| `checklist-manifest` | Builds the codebase-grounded checklist manifest before work and reconciles the same checklist at completion. |
| `codex-sdk-harness-product` | Grounds SDK/database harness and product-client claims in shipped code; read-only context, not implementation ownership. |
| `orchestrate-planner` | Builds production plans and stable checklists. |
| `plugin-router` | Selects capability mixes, hidden plugins/skills, profiles, validators, and exposure recommendations. |
| `context-artifact-specialist` | Defines Context Artifact, Capsule, Brief, and trust-boundary requirements. |
| `action-rail-specialist` | Produces safe next actions with validators and approval gates. |
| `validator-reporter` | Chooses checks and reconciles validation evidence. |
| `epistemic-graphrag-specialist` | Gathers GraphRAG/GNN-RAG evidence context, retrieval operators, and trace needs. |
| `federation-learning-recorder` | Prepares local learning and safe structural federation candidates. |
| `redis-harness-operator` | Provides Redis harness guardrails for cache/run/event boundaries and fallback behavior. |
| `redis-product-safety` | Provides tenant THG product safety checks for auth, Redis key isolation, and RESP gates. |

## Commands Exposed

Default adaptive product command:

- `/harness`

Utility commands:

- `/coordinate`
- `/peer-review`
- `/research`
- `/encode`
- `/compute_code`
- `/replay-last-run`
- `/writing-engineering`

`/compute_code` teaches the complete code capability: GraphQL-first
ingest/reindex/status/search/context/explain/spec/drift/features/obligations,
with the consolidated flat MCP fallbacks documented in `CODE_CAPABILITY.md`.

Harness memory teaching is GraphQL-first across `memory`, `memoryDoc`, nested
`links`/`related`, `memoryArchive`, `rememberMemory`, `reviseMemory`,
`forgetMemory`, and `createHandoff`. It preserves ranked episode provenance and
keeps actor-memory/Data API tools, retro-import, opt-out, deduplication,
reentrancy, and practice promotion in their real boundaries. See
`MEMORY_CAPABILITY.md`.

Canonical verification teaching covers GraphQL and flat receipt record, read,
explain, allocation, and calibration reliability surfaces. It preserves
support/attack lineage, graph-version freshness, authenticated actor/binding
admission, self-reported head/model limits, and the boundary between reliability
tiers and authorization. See `VERIFICATION_CAPABILITY.md`.

Identity and binding teaching prefers typed GraphQL `identityBindingStatus` and
`identityBindingExplain`, with flat `identity_binding_status` and
`identity_binding_explain` for compatibility. The queries accept no identity
arguments; admitted-session authority, selection rules, receipt fields, and
the live proof gaps are in `IDENTITY_CAPABILITY.md`.

Context teaching maps GraphQL `contextStatus`, `contextExplain`,
`refreshContext`, and `invalidateContext` to flat `context_status`,
`context_explain`, `harness_prepare`, and `context_invalidate`. It preserves
lease decisions, included/excluded spans, stale/evicted generations, and the
fact that current PostToolUse/PreCompact hooks do not advance the context
epoch. See `CONTEXT_CAPABILITY.md`.

Commitments and policy teaching uses GraphQL `writeCoordinationRecord` and
`recordClaim` plus flat `coordination_record`, `commitment_retract`,
`commitment_supersede`, and `commitment_check` for their current coordination
contracts. It keeps the canonical Rust `assert_typed_claim`, typed commitment,
and structured constitution-refusal seams explicitly non-remote. See
`COMMITMENTS_POLICY_CAPABILITY.md`.

Graph Lisp teaching covers the crate-local `execute_capability` envelope and
its pure bounded operations. It does not invent an MCP/GraphQL/dynamic surface;
granted effects still refuse with `external_executor_required`. See
`GRAPH_LISP_CAPABILITY.md`.

Data and reconstruction teaching uses typed GraphQL `dataSchema` through
`upsertDataView`, the exact `harnessKg*` reads, and the seven
`reverseEngineerCompose` through `reverseEngineerPort` mutations where those
projections exist. It preserves flat-only `datawave_ingest`, `resolve_ingest`,
`resolve_entities`, `resolve_explain`, `memory_dedup_report`, `reconstruct`, and
`reconstruct_binary`, plus source pins, receipts, unknowns, and unresolved
obligations. See `DATA_RECONSTRUCTION_CAPABILITY.md`.

Learning and evolution teaching uses canonical verification/calibration,
ordinary memory/run outcomes, practice learning, and flat `programmable_graph`
proposal validation where those remote seams exist. GEPA trainsets/gates,
ReasoningBank entry points, and `theorem-evolve` evaluation/promotion remain
Rust-only and cannot be presented as remote lifecycle actions. See
`LEARNING_EVOLUTION_CAPABILITY.md`.

Agent interoperability teaching uses flat `composed_agent_run`, durable
`stream_publish` Head Calls, and the authenticated Head Call and ACP WebSocket
routes. A2A card registration/invocation remains crate-level, and configured
providers are not described as live without invocation receipts. See
`AGENT_INTEROP_CAPABILITY.md`.

Stable solver teaching uses only the dynamic `tool_search` -> `describe` ->
`invoke` sequence for `constraint.check` and `constraint.optimize`, preserving
budgets, provider provenance, refusal, and proof eligibility. See
`SOLVER_CAPABILITY.md`.

Programmable WASM teaching exposes installed app exports through the same
dynamic gateway while keeping publish, promote, inspect, selected invocation,
receipt lookup, and rollback at the current Rust substrate boundary. See
`PROGRAMMABLE_WASM_CAPABILITY.md`.

Verified cognition teaching is a disciplined composition of
`constraint.check`, reconstruction stages, canonical verification receipts,
and the Plan lifecycle. The planned verified-decision, consistency,
reconstruction, repair, and voice orchestrators are not callable surfaces. See
`VERIFIED_COGNITION_CAPABILITY.md`.

Internal capability language:

- `theorize` -> `/harness mode=theorize`

## Compatibility Risks

- Host environments may retain an installed-cache copy of removed skills until
  the plugin is refreshed. Source and generated manifests intentionally omit
  every retired interface, and none has an alias.
- Redis/harness writeback is environment-sensitive. Orchestrate must report
  writeback as proven or deferred per run.
- The default harness SDK client and tenant-scoped THG product client remain
  separate surfaces and must not be merged in docs or reports.
